    </header>

    <p>About a century ago an american computer scientist John McCarthy coined a term &ldquo;Artificial Intilegence&rdquo;. The science and engieneering develpoment of computer systems to perform tasks normally requiring human intillegence, such as visual perception, speech recognization, decision making and translation between languages. We can say we have achieved perfect artificial intillegence when all the applications of AI such as machine learning speech robotics natural language processing expert systems vision are achieved.</p>
<p>Most of the time machine learning is confused with artificial intillegence but they are not completly same things. Machine learning falls under Artificial intillegence. It is a major application of artificial intilegence that provides machines the ability to atonomously learn and improvise themselves without being externally programmed. Machine Learning prioritises on the development of computer programs that can rely on data given by the users and use it to learn for themselves just like an infant learning words from her mother. Machine learning can be categeorized into two sub application, deep learning and Predective analytics. Deep learning is an AI aplication that emulates the functionings of human brain in data processiing and shaping patterns for proper use in decision making. Whereas predective analytics deals with the jobs of making decisions, complex patterns rcognization. Machine learning which includes deep learning and predective analytics plays the role of backbone of Artificial Intelegence. Todays world enjoys machine learning predective analytics as a boon from computer science.</p>
<p>Another key prospect of Artificial intellegence is Speech Recognization. The ability of an device to convert audio to text and text to audio shows the possibility of Artificial intelligence in our future. We have been using AI in speech as siri, alexa, and Google. Natural language processing (NLP) is a part  of Artificial Intelligence that helps computers to understand, interpret and manipulate human language. Natural language processing (NLP) draws from many practices, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its attempt to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It helps in translation of languages. classification and clustering of similar languages resulting in creation of Machine learning and finally artificial intellegence.</p>
<p>Similarly, computer vision is a subset of mainstream artificial intelligence that deals with the science of making computers or machines visually enabled so that they can analyze and understand an image. The prospects of image recognization promises deveplopment of perfect AI capable of human level thinking.</p>
<p>Can you imagine Artificial Inteligence? You imagine a robot right? Robotics completes Artificial Intelligence and we can say it as the Face of Artifical Intelligence. After the combination of aspects of AI suchas machine learning, machine vision, Natural language processing we can finally create a body for Artificial Intilligence and this body is known as a robot.</p>
<p>Endless possibilities, unimaginable progress, and prosperous mankind. These are the promises of Artificial Intellegence and I believe computer doesnot lie.</p>
