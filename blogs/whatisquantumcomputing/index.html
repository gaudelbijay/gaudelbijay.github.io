    </header>

    <p>Invention is the necessity rather let it be defined as an incredibility. Quantum computing is an epitome  justified to the sentence. Reviewing the civilization history, the hungers who made it happen are Isaac Chuang of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Neil Gershenfeld of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Mark Kubinec of the University of California at Berkeley who first created the first quantum computer (2-qubit) that could be loaded with data and output a solution.</p>
<p>Quantum computing is an area of computing focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory, which explains the behavior of energy and material on the atomic and subatomic levels. They have the potential to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers. Quantum computer works on quantum bits, also known as qubits. Qubits have special properties. They can exist in superposition, where they are both 0 and 1 at the same time, and they may be entangled so they share physical properties even in long distance. There are several models of quantum computing, including the quantum circuit model, quantum Turing machine, adiabatic quantum computer, one-way quantum computer, and various quantum cellular automata. The most widely used model is the quantum circuit. Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or &ldquo;qubit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Understanding superposition makes it possible to understand qubit. In classical computing, bits are transistors that can be off or on, corresponding to the states 0 and 1. In qubits such as electrons, 0 and 1 simply correspond to states like the lower and upper energy levels. Qubits are distinguished from classical bits, which must always be in the 0 or 1 state, by their ability to be in superpositions with varying probabilities that can be manipulated by quantum operations during computations.</p>
<p>The fields like Cybersecurity, Drug Development, Financial Modeling, Better Batteries, Cleaner Fertilization, Traffic Optimization, Weather Forecasting, and 
Solar Capture are being benefitted by quantum computing. Furthermore,
Quantum computers could spur the development of new breakthroughs in science, medications to save lives, machine learning methods to diagnose illnesses sooner, materials to make more efficient devices and structures, financial strategies to live well in retirement, and algorithms to quickly direct resources. Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize computation by making certain types of classically intractable problems solvable. Two of the most prominent areas of quantum computing: first, quantum sensing and metrology, which leverage the extreme sensitivity of qubits to the environment to realize sensing beyond the classical shot noise limit, and second, quantum networks and communications, which may lead to revolutionary ways to share information.</p>
<p>While no quantum computer is yet sophisticated enough to carry out calculations that a classical computer can&rsquo;t, great progress is under way. 
The most challenging part on this incredible invention goes to creation of quibit. There are a few different ways to create a qubit. One method uses superconductivity to create and maintain a quantum state. To work with these superconducting qubits for extended periods of time, they must be kept very cold. Any heat in the system can introduce error so operation  temperatures close to absolute zero, colder than the vacuum of space. Coming to the point it could be hard and tough for the general society to accommodate with the quantum computing as the structure leads to be more costly as well.</p>
<p>Today, real quantum processors are used by researchers from all over the world to test out algorithms for applications in a variety of fields. Now quantum computing has been purely a theorical aspect as well. There are challenges that todayâs systems will never be able to solve. For problems above a certain size and complexity, we donât have enough computational power on Earth to tackle them. To stand a chance at solving some of these problems, we need quantum computing. It is the time for taking next leap in development and civilization; understanding and utilizing the power of real science. Importantly, it&rsquo;s the necessity of our growing and valued civilization rather a incredibility&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
