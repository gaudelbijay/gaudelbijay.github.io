This repository implements an event-driven reinforcement learning framework for autonomous robot navigation using neuromorphic event cameras. Instead of relying on dense frame-based sensors or laser scanners, the system processes asynchronous event streams to produce compact Binary Event Maps and learns a self-supervised contrastive perception embedding optimized for navigation. The learned representation is used by reinforcement learning policies including MLP, CNN, GRU, and Transformer agents trained with Soft Actor-Critic. The approach achieves navigation performance comparable to laser-based systems in simulation and successfully transfers to a real Jackal UGV with minimal real-world calibration.

### System Platform

- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- ROS Distribution: ROS Noetic
- GPU: 2x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4500 Ada
- CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper
- System Memory: 128 GB RAM

This platform was used for training reinforcement learning agents and self-supervised event-based perception models.

### Dependencies

#### ROS Noetic

https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

#### Clearpath Jackal Simulator (ROS Noetic)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-jackal-simulator \
                   ros-noetic-jackal-desktop \
                   ros-noetic-jackal-navigation
```

#### Install Apptainer

This project uses Apptainer for containerized workflows.

- Official Apptainer documentation: https://apptainer.org/docs/
- Direct installation instructions: https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html

After installing, verify:

```bash
apptainer --version
```

#### Build the Apptainer Image

```bash
apptainer build event_nav.sif Singularity.def
```

Move the built image `event_nav.sif` to the `local_buffer` directory.

#### Install catkin tools (if needed)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-catkin-tools
```

#### Clone, build, and source the workspace

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:gaudelbijay/event_jackal.git

cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

### Training

Quick start:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Overview:

- Training is controlled by YAML config files under `configs/`.
- Pass the config path with `--config` to `train.py`.

```bash
python train.py --config configs/generalization/num_world_50.yaml
```

### Testing

```bash
python tester.py
```

Configuration files do not need to be specified manually. During training, the active configuration is automatically copied into `local_buffer`, and `tester.py` uses that stored configuration for evaluation.
